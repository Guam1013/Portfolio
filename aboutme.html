<p> I live in Chesapeake, Virginia but I call San Diego, California home. </p>
I like In-n-Out Burger, field hockey, 30 Rock and Parks and Recreation, and sleeping and I despise snails.
<p> I once went swimming with a monkey in Bali. </p>

<p> Reflection </p>
<p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both have innovated to make tasks easier for people/ Veloso's Co-Bot helps with tasks around the office while Howard's tech device helps special needs children use technology. Their oher devices are also for human improvement. Veloso's soccer bots brings happiness and enjoyment in entertainment while Howard's Mars Rovers help with innovation and exploration. </p>
<p> On our robot, no one on my team had experience with coding or programming them, so we all muddled through it together. We could have improved our teamwork by dividing up the work and then coming together. </p>
<p> In every Arduino sketch we need semicolons, loops, and for statements. </p>
