<h1> My name is Madeleine Nations and I am enrolled in Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program. </h1>
<p> I live in Chesapeake, Virginia but I call San Diego, California home. </p>
I like In-n-Out Burger, field hockey, running, and sleeping and I despise snails.
I once went swimming with a monkey in Bali.
